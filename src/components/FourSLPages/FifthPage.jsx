          Receiving Christ means turning to God from self (repentance) and trusting Christ to enter our lives, forgive our sins, and transform us according to His will. 
          Merely agreeing intellectually that Jesus is the Son of God or having an emotional experience is insufficient. 
          We must receive Jesus Christ by faith, as an act of will.
